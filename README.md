Blockchain application for data access management üîê



## Abstract

Access control is a crucial part of a system's security, restricting what actions users can perform on resources. Therefore, access control is a core component when dealing with e-Health data and resources, discriminating which is available for a certain party. We consider that current systems that attempt to assure the share of policies between facilities are prone to system's and network's faults and do not assure the integrity of policies lifecycle. By approaching this problem with the use of a distributed ledger, namely a consortium blockchain, where the operations are stored as transactions, we ensure that the different facilities have knowledge about all the parties that can act over the e-Health resources while maintaining integrity, auditability, authenticity, and scalability.
